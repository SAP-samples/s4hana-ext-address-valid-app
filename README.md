# SAP S/4HANA Cloud Extensions - Collaborative Address Validation Using SAP Enterprise Eventing Services
This repository contains the sample code for the [Collaborative Address Validation Using SAP Enterprise Eventing Services tutorial](http://tiny.cc/s4-address-valid-app).

*This code is only one part of the tutorial, so please follow the tutorial before attempting to use this code.*

## Description

The [Collaborative Address Validation Using SAP Enterprise Eventing Services tutorial](http://tiny.cc/s4-address-valid-app) showcases an extension to an SAP S/4HANA Cloud system. This scenario is a collaborative use case to enable customers to validate their company address changes. Once the address of a customer is being changed in the SAP S/4HANA Cloud system, a business event is being pushed to the connected SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP) (Cloud Foundry) account. Upon receiving the event, the Java application sends a notification email to the contact person including address details. The email also contains a secured link to an SAPUI5 application where the contact person can confirm the address and adjust it when necessary. The confirmed address is then written back to the SAP S/4HANA Cloud system.
